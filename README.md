# Hardware and Embedded Security - Exercises and Labs

## Course Overview
This repository contains exercises and laboratory assignments related to the **Hardware and Embedded Security** course at @polito. The course covers various aspects of hardware security, including VLSI design, IP protection, hardware trust, and different types of attacks and countermeasures. Students will explore topics such as watermarking, PCB security, side-channel attacks, hardware trojans, and secure design methodologies. The course combines theoretical foundations with practical applications to strengthen security in embedded systems.

## Repository Contents
This repository stores hardware description code and related implementations for the laboratory exercises. The main focus is on writing secure hardware designs using:

- **Verilog**
- **VHDL**

These implementations aim to reinforce the security concepts learned during the course, providing hands-on experience in designing and protecting hardware components from various threats.
